## My goal
- program as much as I can
- make the best projects I can
- remember what I learn to avoid wasting time

## Studies
- probably not the best seeing as I mainly read free books
- focus on python
- figure out simplicity

## A little bit about myself

- [x] use dvorak
- [x] use terminal
- [x] read manuals
- [x] very quiet
- [x] oblivious to social media and politics
